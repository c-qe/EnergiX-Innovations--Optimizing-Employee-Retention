## About Advanced Energy
Advanced Energy (AE), a French-based manufacturer of alternative energy vehicles, boasts a workforce exceeding 100,000 employees. They are dedicated to every aspect of the vehicle production process, including research, design, construction, validation, and distribution of electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Through their comprehensive vertical integration model, AE has ascended to a position of global prominence, standing at the forefront of the convergence between alternative energy solutions and the automotive industry.

## Business Problem
AE is currently experiencing a significant turnover rate among its employees, involving both voluntary resignations and involuntary departures. This high turnover rate results in substantial financial costs. Considering the considerable investments made in recruitment, training, and skill development, predicting employee departures and understanding the underlying reasons could significantly enhance corporate culture, reduce overall financial costs, and consequently foster company growth. To tackle this issue, the project's primary focus is on predicting employee departures and comprehending the root causes to improve retention.

## Objectives
- Clean, preprocess, and organize the data for analysis.
- Utilize various visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) to comprehend relationships between variables and identify turnover-related patterns.
- Create a predictive model for employee turnover using survey data.
- Analyze the model outcomes to pinpoint the primary factors influencing turnover.
- Formulate actionable strategies to enhance retention based on the model's findings (e.g., improving work conditions, fostering career development, enhancing management practices).

## Model Development and Evaluation
- Experiment with statistical models (e.g., logistic regression) and machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, random forests, XGBoost) to predict employee turnover.
- Apply k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.
- Implement the predictive model in a controlled environment for testing and validation.
- Regularly update and improve the model based on new data and feedback.

## Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of methodologies, data, model development, and findings.
- Generate detailed reports summarizing insights, recommendations, and the predictive model's performance.

## Key Considerations
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical considerations.
- Establish a feedback loop to incorporate HR and management feedback for model improvement.
