### About EnergiX
EnergiX Innovations (EI), a French-based manufacturer of alternative energy vehicles, boasts a workforce exceeding 100,000 employees. They are dedicated to every aspect of the vehicle production process, including research, design, construction, validation, and distribution of electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Through their comprehensive vertical integration model, EI has ascended to a position of global prominence, standing at the forefront of the convergence between alternative energy solutions and the automotive industry.

### Business Problem and Objective
EI is currently experiencing a significant turnover rate among its employees, involving both voluntary resignations and involuntary departures. This high turnover rate results in substantial financial costs. Considering the considerable investments made in recruitment, training, and skill development, predicting employee departures and understanding the underlying reasons could significantly enhance corporate culture, reduce overall financial costs, and consequently foster company growth. To tackle this issue, the project's primary focus is on predicting employee departures and comprehending the root causes to improve retention.
