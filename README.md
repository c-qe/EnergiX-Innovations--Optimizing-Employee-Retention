    <h3>Project Turnkey: Enhancing Retention for a Thriving Workforce</h3>
</div>

### About the Company

Avant-Garde Énergétique (AE), a French-based manufacturer of alternative energy vehicles, boasts a workforce exceeding 100,000 employees. They are dedicated to every aspect of the vehicle production process, including research, design, construction, validation, and distribution of electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Through their comprehensive vertical integration model, AE has ascended to a position of global prominence, standing at the forefront of the convergence between alternative energy solutions and the automotive industry.

### Scenario

AE is currently experiencing a notable turnover rate among its employees, encompassing both voluntary resignations and involuntary departures. The senior leadership team at AE is deeply concerned about this trend and is committed to fostering a corporate culture that nurtures employee growth and professional advancement. Additionally, the high turnover rate incurs significant financial costs, given the substantial investments made in recruitment, training, and skill development. Recognizing the potential benefits of predicting employee departures and understanding the underlying reasons, AE aims to address this issue effectively.

To initiate this effort, the leadership team has tasked the Human Resources department with conducting surveys among a sample of employees to glean insights into the factors influencing turnover. Subsequently, they have turned to you to analyze the survey data and formulate strategies to enhance employee retention. The suggestion is to devise a predictive model that anticipates employee departures based on variables such as job title, department, project involvement, monthly working hours, and other pertinent factors. A robust model promises to elevate retention rates, bolster job satisfaction for existing employees, and yield savings in both time and resources otherwise spent on training new hires.

Given your expertise in data analysis, the leadership team entrusts you with choosing the approach that will yield the most effective predictive model for employee turnover. This may involve constructing and evaluating statistical models like logistic regression, or exploring machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost. Alternatively, a combination of both statistical and machine learning models could be deployed. Regardless of the chosen approach, a thorough examination of the pivotal factors influencing turnover, the development of a robust model, and the provision of actionable recommendations will be crucial components of the project's success.
